		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>The <b>World Wide Web</b> or <strong>Web</strong> is not synonymous with the internet but <mark>Web is the most importent part of the internet</mark> that can be defined as a techno-social system to interact humans based on technological networks. The notion of the techno-social system refers to a system that enhances human cognition, communication, and co-operation; Cognition is the necessary prerequisite to communicate and the precondition to co-operate. In other words, cooperation needs communication and communication needs cognition.<br/><br/>Web is the largest transformable-information construct that its idea was introduced by <i>Tim Burners-Lee</i> in 1989 at first. Much progress has been made about the web and related technologies in the past two decades. Web 1.0 as a web of cognition, web 2.0 as a web of communication, web 3.0 as a web of co-operation and web 4.0 as a web of integration are introduced such as four generation of the web since the advent of the web.</p>

		<h4><u>Web 1.0</u></h4>
		<p><big>Web 1.0</big> is the first generation of the web which according to <i>Berners-Lee</i>, could be considered the <mark>read-only web</mark> and also as a system of cognition. <big>Web 1.0</big> began as an information place for businesses to broadcast their information to people. The early web provided a limited user interactions or content contributions and only allowed to search the information and read it.</p>
		<h4><u>Web 2.0</u></h4>
		<p><big>Web 2.0</big> was defined by <i>Dale Dougherty</i> in 2004 as a <mark>read-write web</mark>. The technologies of <big>web 2.0</big> allow assembling and managing large global crowds with common interests in social interactions. The differences between web 1.0 and web 2.0 are numerous that are described in the reminder of the paper.</p>
		<h4><u>Web 3.0</u></h4>
		<p><big>Web 3.0</big> or <mark>semantic web</mark> desires to decrease humanâ€™s tasks and decisions and leave them to machines by providing <em>machine-readable contents</em> on the web. In General, <big>web 3.0</big> is included two main platforms, semantic technologies and social computing environment. The semantic technologies represent open standards that can be applied on the top of the web. The social computing environment allows human-machine co-operations and organizing a large number of the social web communities</p>
		<h4><u>Web 4.0</u></h4>
		<p><big>Web 4.0</big> will be as a read-write-execution-concurrency web with intelligent interactions, but there is still no exact definition of it. <big>Web 4.0</big> is also known as <em>symbiotic web</em> in which human mind and machines can interact in symbiosis.Web 4.0 is still an underground idea in progress and there is no exact definition of how it would be. <big>Web 4.0</big> is also known as <mark>symbiotic web</mark>. The dream behind of the symbiotic web is interaction between humans and machines in symbiosis. It will be possible to build more powerful interfaces such as mind controlled interfaces using web 4.0. In simple words, machines would be clever on reading the contents of the web, and react in the form of executing and deciding what to execute first to load the websites fast with superior quality and performance and build more commanding interfaces</p>

		<h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3>
		<p>Web 1.0, web 2.0, web 3.0 and web 4.0 were described as four generations of the web. The characteristics of the generations are introduced and compared. It is concluded web as an information space has had much progress since 1989 and it is moving toward using artificial intelligent techniques to be as a massive web of highly intelligent interactions in close future. Future work on this paper will focus on the deeper and broader research about the semantic web and its issues.</p>
